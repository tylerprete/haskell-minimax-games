# Minimax Games

I was digging around in my old college archives and found these.

They weren't quite working with modern ghc and build tools,
so I've resurrected them and made them work with stack.

I probably won't update these at all.

To build:
  1. ```stack setup```
  2. ```stack build```

To run TicTacToe:
```stack exec tictactoe-exe```

To run Kalah:
```stack exec kalah-exe```
